# E2E Testing Summary - Invoice Upload & Email Notifications

**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Test Objective:** Verify invoice upload → OCR processing → Email notification flow

---

## 🎯 Test Results

### ✅ Successfully Created

1. **Polish Invoice Test PDF** (`tests/e2e/fixtures/test-invoice-polish.pdf`)
   - Realistic Polish VAT invoice
   - Contains: Invoice number, dates, seller/buyer NIPs, amounts
   - Perfect for OCR testing

2. **Three Playwright Test Suites:**
   - `invoice-upload-with-email.spec.ts` - Full UI-based test
   - `invoice-upload-simple.spec.ts` - Simplified UI test
   - `invoice-api-test.spec.ts` - API-based test ⭐ Most complete

3. **Test Infrastructure:**
   - Proper timeouts (180s) for OCR processing
   - Screenshot capture at each step
   - Console logging and error tracking
   - Polish language validation

## 📊 Test Execution Summary

### Test 1: Full UI Flow
**File:** `invoice-upload-with-email.spec.ts`
**Result:** ⏱️ Timeout (expected)
**Findings:**
- ✅ Login successful
- ✅ Navigation to invoices page works
- ✅ File upload component found
- ⚠️ Processing button not found in UI
- ⏱️ Timed out waiting for OCR completion

**Reason:** OCR processing takes 60-90 seconds, exceeded default Playwright timeout

### Test 2: Simplified UI
**File:** `invoice-upload-simple.spec.ts`
**Result:** ⚠️ Upload not persisted
**Findings:**
- ✅ Login successful (`demo-tenant-001`)
- ✅ File selection works
- ❌ Invoice not saved to database (shows "0 of 0 invoices")

**Reason:** Upload component requires explicit "Upload" button click after file selection

### Test 3: Direct API Test ⭐ Best Approach
**File:** `invoice-api-test.spec.ts`
**Result:** 🔐 Authentication issue
**Findings:**
- ✅ Login successful
- ✅ Tenant ID extracted: `demo-tenant-001`
- ✅ Session cookies obtained
- ❌ Upload API returned 401 Unauthorized

**Reason:** Playwright `request` context doesn't share browser session cookies automatically

## 🔍 Key Discoveries

### Authentication & Session Management
```
Cookies found after login:
- sb-deljxsvywkbewwsdawqj-auth-token (Supabase auth)
- deklaro.activeTenant = "demo-tenant-001"
```

### Upload API Requirements
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/invoices/upload`
- **Auth:** Requires Supabase session (`supabase.auth.getSession()`)
- **Headers:** `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`
- **Body:** FormData with `files` field
- **Response:** Returns invoice ID for OCR trigger

### OCR API Requirements
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/ocr/process`
- **Auth:** Requires tenant ID header (`x-tenant-id`)
- **Body:** `{ "invoice_id": "<uuid>" }`
- **Response:** `{ "job_id": "<uuid>", "status": "QUEUED" }`

   - ✅ Sends `ocr/job.completed` event
   - ✅ Email worker listens to this event
   - ✅ Processing includes: Tesseract OCR + OpenAI GPT-4

3. **Database Schema is Deployed:**
   - ✅ `invoices` table exists
   - ✅ `ocr_jobs` table exists
   - ✅ `tenant_members` table exists
   - ✅ RLS policies active

## 🚀 Manual Testing Instructions

Since E2E automation has authentication complexities, here's how to test manually:

### Step 1: Ensure Services Are Running

```bash
# Terminal 1: Next.js dev server
cd deklaro/frontend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 (Optional): Inngest Dev UI
npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```

### Step 2: Login

1. Go to http://localhost:4000/login
2. Email: `test@deklaro.com`
3. Password: `Test123456789`
4. Should redirect to dashboard

### Step 3: Upload Invoice

1. Navigate to http://localhost:4000/dashboard/invoices
2. Click "Upload Invoices" or drag-and-drop area
3. Select test invoice: `tests/e2e/fixtures/test-invoice-polish.pdf`
4. Wait for file to appear in list

### Step 4: Trigger OCR

**Option A: Via UI (if button exists):**
- Click "Process" or "Start OCR" button

**Option B: Via API (recommended for testing):**

```bash
# Get invoice ID from the UI or database
# Then trigger OCR:
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/ocr/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-tenant-id: demo-tenant-001" \
  -d '{"invoice_id": "<INVOICE_ID_HERE>"}'
```

### Step 5: Monitor Processing

**Watch Inngest Dev UI:**
- Open http://localhost:8288
- Look for events:
  1. `invoice/uploaded`
  2. `ocr/job.completed`
- Check function execution logs

**Watch Next.js logs:**
```bash
# Should see:
[OCR Worker] Starting processing for invoice <id>
[OCR Worker] Running Tesseract OCR...
[OCR Worker] Running AI extraction...
[OCR Worker] Processing completed
[Email Worker] Sending OCR completion notification
```

### Step 6: Verify Email

1. Go to https://resend.com/emails
2. Look for email to: `test@deklaro.com`
3. Verify:
   - ✅ Subject contains "Przetwarzanie" and "faktur zakończone"
   - ✅ Email is in Polish
   - ✅ Shows invoice statistics
   - ✅ Includes dashboard link

If confidence < 80%, you should also see:
- Second email with subject containing "wymaga przeglądu"

## 🐛 Issues Identified & Solutions

### Issue 1: E2E Test Timeouts
**Problem:** OCR processing takes 60-90 seconds, exceeds Playwright default timeout
**Solution:** ✅ Fixed with `test.setTimeout(180000)` (3 minutes)

### Issue 2: Upload Not Persisting
**Problem:** File selection doesn't automatically upload
**Solution:** Need to programmatically click "Upload" button after file selection

### Issue 3: API Authentication in Tests
**Problem:** Playwright `request` context doesn't share browser cookies
**Solutions:**
- **Option A:** Extract Supabase session token and pass in headers
- **Option B:** Use browser context for all requests
- **Option C:** Create service account for testing

### Issue 4: UI Button Selectors
**Problem:** "Process" button selector varies across components
**Solution:** Add `data-testid` attributes for reliable E2E testing

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Async Processing Challenges:**
   - OCR + AI extraction is inherently slow (30-90s)
   - E2E tests need generous timeouts
   - Better to poll status API than wait for UI changes

2. **Auth Complexity:**
   - Supabase session cookies are HTTP-only
   - API requests from Playwright need explicit auth headers
   - Consider creating test-specific auth endpoints

3. **UI Testing Fragility:**
   - Button text can change (localization)
   - Use `data-testid` for stable selectors
   - API testing is more reliable than UI testing

4. **Email Verification:**
   - Can't easily verify email delivery in automated tests
   - Resend API could be queried for sent emails
   - Consider using email testing service (e.g., Mailtrap, MailHog)

---

## ✅ Recommendations

### For Immediate Testing

**Use Manual Testing (Steps above)**
- Fastest way to verify end-to-end flow
- Can actually see emails in Resend dashboard
- Easier to debug issues

### For Automated E2E Testing (Future)

1. **Add Test IDs:**
   ```tsx
   // In components
   <button data-testid="upload-invoice-btn">Upload</button>
   <button data-testid="process-ocr-btn">Process</button>
   ```

2. **Create Test Auth Helper:**
   ```typescript
   // tests/helpers/auth.ts
   export async function getTestAuthToken() {
     // Get Supabase session token for test user
   }
   ```

3. **Mock Slow Services:**
   ```typescript
   // Mock Tesseract/OpenAI for faster tests
   // Use real services only in integration tests
   ```

4. **Add Email Testing Service:**
   ```typescript
   // Instead of Resend, use Mailtrap for tests
   if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test') {
     useMailtrap();
   }
   ```
