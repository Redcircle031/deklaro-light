## 💡 Pro Tips for Testing

### Use These Test NIPs

In test environment, these NIPs are commonly used:

```
Valid format NIPs (fake, for testing):
- 0000000000
- 1111111111
- 1234567890
- 9876543210
```

### Test Different Scenarios

- ✅ Submit valid invoice → Should succeed
- ✅ Submit invoice with missing fields → Should show validation errors
- ✅ Check status of submitted invoice → Should show ACCEPTED
- ✅ Try to submit same invoice twice → Should handle gracefully
- ✅ Cancel submission before complete → Should cleanup properly

### Test Invoice Template

```json
{
  "invoiceNumber": "FV/TEST/001/2025",
  "issueDate": "2025-01-19",
  "sellerNIP": "1234567890",
  "buyerNIP": "0987654321",
  "items": [
    {
      "description": "Test Service",
      "quantity": 1,
      "unitPrice": 100.00,
      "vatRate": 23
